        <p>Stardew Valley is an open-ended country-life RPG! You’ve inherited your grandfather’s old farm plot in Stardew Valley. Armed with hand-me-down tools and a few coins, you set out to begin your new life. Can you learn to live off the land and turn these overgrown fields into a thriving home? It won’t be easy. Ever since Joja Corporation came to town, the old ways of life have all but disappeared. The community center, once the town’s most vibrant hub of activity, now lies in shambles. But the valley seems full of opportunity. With a little dedication, you might just be the one to restore Stardew Valley to greatness!</p>

        <p>ConcernedApe is Eric Barone, the creator and lead developer of Stardew Valley, as well as the name of the company he founded to continue game development. From 2012 to 2019, he was the sole developer of the game (except the multiplayer networking code in 1.3) and created all art, sound effects, and music.</p>

        <p>In early 2019, ConcernedApe formed a small development team to continue updating the game. The 1.4 update of the game was developed by ConcernedApe, Arthur Lee (a.k.a. Mr. Podunkian), and Alex Erlandson (a.k.a. zillix). The 1.5 update of the game was developed by ConcernedApe and Arthur Lee.</p>

        <p>To think that Stardew was made by a single developer. The breath and depth of the content is amazing. Even if you use the wiki to somewhat "cheat" and find secrets, there is still a seemingly endless amount of content to discover. Aside from all of the secrets and characters, it's nice to just walk around the Stardew Valley and escape into another virtual life. I highly recommend this game for anyone from a casual gamer to someone into more resource optimization! - Steam, dragonmastur</p>

        <p>Fun and relaxing game. Always something to do and the updates keep it interesting. I am 72, have tried to play other games, but they cannot compete with Stardew, so I only play Stardew. Thank you, Concerned Ape. - Steam, Morgan</p>

        <p>literally one of the best farming games I've ever purchased. I love that the game gives you the basics but doesn't hold your hand on how you want to play. you start out easy and then over time you get more recipes and improve your skills which in turn allows you to advance your farm which makes it more challenging. I honestly love that the game doesn't hold you back on what you want to do until your ready. - Google Play, daniel ruskan</p>
