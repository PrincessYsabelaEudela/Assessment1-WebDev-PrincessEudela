        <p>I realised belatedly that this was a fresh new take on Beauty and The Beast only when the Beast was introduced, so I thought that this would be a typical romance story. But it wasn't and although it had darker themes such as child ab*se, it was handled quite alright - nothing too explicit but the ending felt incomplete. The visuals were stunning and the songs were incredibly beautiful. That last song even brought me to tears. - jasminn_tan, IMDb</p>

        <p>Despite not sticking the landing with his script, Hosada manages to successfully manipulate our emotions with moments of powerful themes accented by incredible visuals and musical performances. - Patrick Hicks</p>

        <p>Belle is easily one of the best animated films of 2021! Mamoru Hosoda has taken concept of Beauty and the Beast & made it something truly awe-inspiring! The music, voice acting, emotional depth, and character story telling is something to never forget! - Samuel Leggett Jr.</p>
